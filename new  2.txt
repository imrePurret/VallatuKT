A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph G is a cycle containing all vertices of G.
This notion may seem quite similar to an Eulerian tour but it turns out
that it is much more difficult to handle. For instance, no efficient algorithm
is known for deciding whether a graph has a Hamiltonian cycle
or not. This and the next two exercises are a microscopic introduction
to this notion (another nice result is mentioned in Exercise 5.3.3).

(a) Decide which of the graphs drawn in Fig. 6.1 has a Hamiltonian
cycle. Try to prove your claims!
(b) Construct two connected graphs with the same score, one with and
one without a Hamiltonian cycle.
